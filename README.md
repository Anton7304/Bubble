# Bubble
The bubbleProject project performs the following functions:

creating N-balls, the number of balls is entered manually by the user;

Create a ball by clicking the left mouse button on the form of the program;

Moving the ball when clicking the middle mouse button;

delete the ball by right-clicking the mouse.

The balls are attracted to each other with the force: F(r) = 1/r-1/r^2, where r is the distance between the balls. If r is less than 1, then they repel.
